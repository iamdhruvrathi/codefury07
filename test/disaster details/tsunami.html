        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>A tsunami is a series of ocean waves caused by the displacement of water, often due to underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. Tsunamis can cause widespread destruction along coastlines.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="info">
        <h2>How They Occur</h2>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>Tsunamis are usually triggered by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. When there is a sudden displacement of water, it generates waves that travel across the ocean.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Propagation</h3>
            <p>Once generated, tsunami waves travel at high speeds across the ocean. As they approach shallower waters near the coast, they slow down and increase in height, leading to potentially devastating impacts.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="info">
        <h2>Dangers</h2>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Waves</h3>
            <p>Tsunami waves can reach heights of over 30 meters (100 feet), causing significant damage to coastal structures and landscapes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Inundation</h3>
            <p>The force of the tsunami can flood coastal areas, leading to severe damage and destruction.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="info">
        <h2>Regions at Risk</h2>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Pacific Ring of Fire</h3>
            <p>This region, including countries like Japan, Indonesia, and Chile, is highly susceptible to tsunamis due to frequent seismic activity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Indian Ocean</h3>
            <p>Countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia are also at risk, particularly near tectonic plate boundaries.</p>
        </div>
