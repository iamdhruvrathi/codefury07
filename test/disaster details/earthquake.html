        <h1>Understanding Earthquakes</h1>
        <p>Learn about earthquakes, their causes, impacts, and how to stay safe.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="info">
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>An earthquake is the shaking of the Earth’s surface caused by a sudden release of energy in the Earth’s crust. This energy release creates seismic waves that can cause significant ground movement and damage.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="info">
        <h2>How They Occur</h2>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>Earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates along faults in the Earth’s crust. When these plates grind against each other, stress builds up and is released as an earthquake.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Seismic Waves</h3>
            <p>The release of energy creates seismic waves that spread out from the earthquake’s epicenter, causing shaking and ground movement.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="info">
        <h2>Dangers</h2>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Building Damage</h3>
            <p>Earthquakes can cause structural damage to buildings, bridges, and roads, leading to potential collapse.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Aftershocks</h3>
            <p>Aftershocks are smaller quakes that follow the main earthquake and can cause further damage.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="info">
        <h2>Regions at Risk</h2>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Earthquake Zones</h3>
            <p>Regions located near tectonic plate boundaries, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire, are highly susceptible to earthquakes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Fault Lines</h3>
            <p>Areas near major fault lines, like the San Andreas Fault in California, are also at high risk.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="info">
        <h2>How to Stay Safe</h2>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>Before</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Prepare Your Home: Secure heavy items, reinforce walls, and ensure that your home meets earthquake-resistant standards.</li>
                <li>Create a Disaster Plan: Develop a plan that includes evacuation routes, emergency contacts, and a family meeting point.</li>
                <li>Emergency Kit: Have an emergency kit ready with essentials like food, water, medications, and important documents.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>During</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Drop, Cover, and Hold On: Drop to your hands and knees, cover your head and neck, and hold on until the shaking stops.</li>
                <li>Stay Indoors: If indoors, stay inside and move away from windows, glass, and heavy objects.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
            <h3>After</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check for Injuries: Provide first aid if necessary and call for medical help if needed.</li>
                <li>Inspect for Damage: Check your home for structural damage, gas leaks, and other hazards.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
