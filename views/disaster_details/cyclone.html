            <h2>What is a Cyclone?</h2>
            <p>A cyclone is a powerful storm system with a low-pressure center, strong winds, and heavy rainfall. It often causes significant damage, especially in coastal areas.</p>

            <h2>Formation and Development</h2>
            <div class="info-item">
                <h3>How Cyclones Form</h3>
                <p>Cyclones develop over warm ocean waters (≥ 26.5°C/80°F) where moist air rises, creating a low-pressure area. This rising air starts to spin due to the Earth’s rotation (Coriolis effect), leading to cyclone formation.</p>

            <div class="info-item">
                <h3>Growth and Structure</h3>
                <p>The cyclone intensifies as it draws in warm air and releases energy. It forms a calm eye at the center, surrounded by an eyewall with the most intense weather.</p>

            <h2>Potential Hazards</h2>
            <div class="info-item">
                <h3>Strong Winds</h3>
                <p>Wind speeds in cyclones can exceed 200 km/h (124 mph), causing severe damage to infrastructure and vegetation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-item">
                <h3>Storm Surge</h3>
                <p>Storm surge pushes ocean water onto land, resulting in flooding and potential destruction in coastal regions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-item">
                <h3>Heavy Rainfall</h3>
                <p>Intense rain can lead to flash flooding and landslides, especially in elevated areas.</p>
